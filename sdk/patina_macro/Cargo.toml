# To avoid circular dependencies, cargo-release skips dev dependencies when evaluating the release order for
# cargo-release, however they are still used when verifying the package is compileable. Any dev-dependency that is
# local to the workspace should be added via `path` instead of `workspace = true` so that that it does not fail to
# compile due to the dev-dependency not being published yet.
