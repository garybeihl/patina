# Patina Samples Crate

This crate contains sample components that demonstrate how to build or use other Patina components. These example
components are meant to serve as references for developers looking to create their own Patina components or understand
and modify working component examples when developing new code.

## Contents

- `hello_world`: A simple component that logs messages during its initialization.

More samples are planned for future inclusion.
