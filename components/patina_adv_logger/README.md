# Patina Advanced Logger

The Patina Advanced Logger provides the Patina core with in-memory and serial logging capabilities.

## Platform Integration

1. Instantiate `AdvancedLogger` with the desired format, filters, level, and serial implementation.
   Register it with `log::set_logger` as early as possible.
2. Discover or provision an Advanced Logger buffer.
   Note: Platform firmware typically passes the Advanced Logger HOB from a prior boot phase.
3. Call `AdvancedLoggerComponent::init_advanced_logger` with the physical HOB list pointer.
   This allows the logger to adopt the buffer and record its address for later protocol publication.
4. Dispatch the `AdvancedLoggerComponent` through Patina so it can install the Advanced Logger protocol via boot
   services.

## Memory Log Behavior

The crate stores records in a shared buffer that begins with an `ADVANCED_LOGGER_INFO` header.

- Aligned entries follow the header.
- Each entry records the boot phase identifier, EFI debug level mask, timestamp counter, and message bytes.

## Parser Support

When the `std` feature is enabled the crate provides a `parser` module for captured log buffers.

It opens the buffer, prints header metadata, and emits log lines with optional level and timestamp context.
This parser underpins host utilities and remains version-aligned with the memory layout implemented in `memory_log.rs`.
